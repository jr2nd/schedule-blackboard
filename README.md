Portfolio Project: Instructions
Objectives 
This is the final stretch before you complete your project. By this time, you should already have a good scaffolding of code for your website. As you flesh out your project and race towards completion, it is time to pause and take stock of the current situation. Perhaps a critical look back at the past, with the view of learning from our experience and consolidating this learning into an effective, organized and repeatable process is in order. Upon completion of the project it is important not only to demonstrate the working project, but also summarize the process of reaching the final goal. Your goal is to:

Document the process of starting from an idea and reaching the conclusion of the project
Learn lessons from the process in understanding what worked and what did not, and being able to make intelligent choices in the future based on the experience
Understand the design and development process through the practice.
Team Scheduler

1. Introduction
This application will allow the scheduling of teams to facilities and assignments.
2. Design and Implementation
Give a detailed description of the design and implementation of your project. 

In particular, this section should contain:

Details of how you converted from design to the actual realization of your project in terms of implementing the code.
Any choices that you made, and any modifications that you made to the design, in response to difficulties that you might have encountered while implementing the project.
A brief discussion of various components that you used in implementing your project, and the reasons you chose them over alternatives.
Include a few screenshots of your website in the report.
3. Conclusions
Discuss what you personally learned from your project.
Discuss the best features and the shortcomings of the project.
Discuss any choices that you might have made differently, in hindsight after completing the project.
